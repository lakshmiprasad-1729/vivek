        <h4>About Disease: 
        </h4>
      </div>
      <span>Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness, numbness, and in severe cases, paralysis. It often begins with tingling sensations in the extremities and can rapidly progress to affect breathing and other vital functions. The exact cause of GBS is unknown, but it is often triggered by infections such as respiratory or gastrointestinal illnesses. Treatment typically involves supportive care, such as intravenous immunoglobulin therapy or plasma exchange, to reduce symptoms and promote recovery. Most individuals with GBS experience significant improvement with time, although recovery can be gradual and may require rehabilitation.
